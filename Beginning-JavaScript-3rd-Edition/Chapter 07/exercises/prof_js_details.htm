<P>This book covers the broad spectrum of programming JavaScript - from the core 
language to browser applications and server-side use to stand-alone and embedded 
JavaScript. 
</P>
<P>
It includes a guide to the language - when where and how to get the 
most out of JavaScript - together with practical case studies demonstrating 
JavaScript in action. Coverage is bang up-to-date, with discussion of 
compatability issues and version differences, and the book concludes with a 
comprehensive reference section. </P>
